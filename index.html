        <h2>About <br> me</h2>
            <p>
                Greetings! I'm Felix Francisco, a motivated and dedicated individual transitioning from a help desk role to pursue a career as a full stack developer. I am thrilled to be part of the dynamic and ever-evolving world of web development, where I can leverage my technical skills and creativity to build innovative solutions.

With a strong foundation in customer support and a genuine interest in technology, I have developed a deep understanding of the challenges users face and the importance of delivering efficient and user-friendly applications. I am now determined to take my skills to the next level and contribute to the development of robust and intuitive web applications.

As a beginner in the field, I am currently immersed in learning the various technologies and frameworks that form the backbone of full stack development. I have a solid grasp of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am actively expanding my knowledge in backend technologies such as Node.js and databases like MongoDB. Additionally, I am eager to gain proficiency in front-end frameworks like React and Angular to enhance the user experience.

One of my strengths lies in my problem-solving abilities. I thrive on finding innovative solutions to complex challenges and enjoy breaking down problems into smaller, manageable tasks. I believe that curiosity, persistence, and a strong desire to learn are essential qualities in this rapidly changing industry, and I embody these qualities every day in my pursuit of mastery.

Aside from technical skills, I possess excellent communication skills and thrive in collaborative environments. I enjoy working as part of a team, exchanging ideas, and learning from experienced professionals. I am always open to feedback and constructive criticism, as I believe they are crucial for personal and professional growth.

In my spare time, you can find me exploring online coding communities, participating in coding challenges, and continuously expanding my knowledge through online tutorials and courses. I am also passionate about staying updated with the latest industry trends and technologies to ensure that my skills remain relevant and adaptable.

I am excited about the endless possibilities that full stack development offers and the opportunity to contribute to projects that make a difference. I am actively seeking new opportunities to apply my skills, contribute to a team, and further develop my capabilities as a full stack developer.

Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me. I look forward to connecting and discussing potential collaborations or opportunities to contribute to your projects!
